# Musica - An AI Music Composer

## Training

To train the network you run **lstm.py**.

E.g.

```
python lstm.py
```

Once you have trained the network you can generate text using **predict.py**

E.g.

```
python predict.py
```

You can run the prediction file right away using the **weights.hdf5** file
